# JLC's Portfolio Thing 

You're not really meant to read this readme.

[Go here to see my "portfolio thing" website instead!](https://joakimch.github.io/jlc-portfolio-thing/)

Feel free to check out the html/css/js though...

Oh, by the way! The Matrix Digital Rain thingy has an MIT license! In case you want to use it...
