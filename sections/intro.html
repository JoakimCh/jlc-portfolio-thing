  <h2 title="Sometimes I wonder about that myself...">Who am I?</h2>
  <p>Hello, I'm JLC (or Joakim L. Christiansen) a <time title="This is actually automatically kept up to date!" id="myAge">...</time> years old dude from Norway (Bergen) and my love in life is computer programming! And I'm previously known for the (now abandoned) <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080730123825/http://www.jlc-software.com/index.php?page=internet_tv.html">JLC's Internet TV</a> software which I made <time id="jlcItvAge">...</time> years ago. <small>Sadly my success quickly got destroyed because of RSI (repetitive strain injury) and depression, both which I have been battling ever since.</small></p>
  
  <p>I never really worked full time as a programmer after this (never worked in a company doing it), but I kept at it as a hobby and I have started WELL OVER 100 hobby projects! <span class="emoji">üòé <small>Didn't finish many though... <span class="emoji">ü§£</span> Yup, my mind is always full of ideas and I want to work on everything that I find exciting! Hence I often jump from project to project, but I have learned TONS doing this though; since I'm never stuck in any comfort zone where I keep doing boring things! <del>(like most employed people do?)</del></p></small>

  <h2 title="Or more like... what can't I do?!">What can I do?</h2>

  <p>Everything mentioned here is stuff that I've learned on my own using the world wide web as my teacher, I didn't take any higher education or any courses of any kind. <small class="do-print">And this process has given me the (maybe most important) skill which is a super ability to figure out stuff on my own! And to actually have an interest in how stuff works at the lowest level! <span class="emoji">ü§ì</span></small></p>

      <h4>Random programming related things I've got experience with <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(in no particular order):</span></h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Advanced bit manipulation (yup, I know how to flip bits <span class="emoji">üòÇ</span>, check my library).</li>
        <li>Database programming in SQL (mainly MySQL and SQLite).</li>
        <li>Advanced Web APIs, many of these https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API (e.g. I've done raw HID programming to communicate with an RGB keyboard straight from the browser).</li>
        <li>Serial port programming (also in the browser btw).</li>
        <li>Different binary network protocols (e.g. DNS).</li>
        <li>And binary file format decoding (e.g. I've written decoders for some of the file formats used by Red Alert 1 and Fallout 2 so I could load assets from those games).</li>
        <li>PWAs (as in installable Progressive Web Apps using manifests and worker threads, see this one).</li>
        <li>The HTTP protocol (mostly before v2).</li>
        <li>Cryptography (e.g. hashing <span class="emoji">üö¨</span>, encryption, authentication <span class="emoji">üîí</span>, TRNGs).</li>
        <li>Security, I am featured in two books about hacking btw (and some news articles that I prefer not to share though <span class="emoji">üòÇ</span>).</li>
        <li>Network sockets (e.g. in C++ and Python).</li>
        <li>WebSockets (I actually wrote my own server/client library for Node.js).</li>
        <li>Writing servers and clients from scratch with custom binary protocols.</li>
        <li>2D graphics (e.g. raw WebGL2).</li>
        <li>Website design (HTML, CSS, JS), I don't identify as a "frontend developer" though.</li>
        <li>Designing API's from scratch.</li>
        <li>Designing libraries/modules that are easy to use (done lots of those).</li>
        <li>Terminal escape codes (like the VT100 uses).</li>
        <li>The unicode standard, e.g. I wrote my own unicode functions in C++ and JavaScript which can convert between all the formats (which are: UTF-8, UTF-16 (with or without BOM) and UTF-32).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 title="throw Error('Not the candidate you're looking for I guess?')">Frameworks <span class="emoji">üìö</span> I like to use:</h4>
      
      <code>[null]</code>
      
      <p><small>Yeah, this one is hard to sell... But I'm a person who enjoys the challenge of doing everything myself, hence for my hobby projects I don't use any frameworks and I develop my own custom ones where it makes sense to do so. This way I learn the underlying technologies better and get a greater perspective on things! But of course I am willing to use whichever frameworks you want me to and I understand the value of them when working on a team with others or on larger projects.</small></p>

        <li>Made my own bluetooth controlled "RC car" (my first project after getting an Arduino), video here.</li>
        <li>Put together my own quadrocopter.</li>
        <li>Made an automated light switch using a PIR sensor and a radio transmitter transmitting codes to my Nexa relay.</li>
        <li>Helped some students (for free) to program a remote-controlled (XBee transceivers) boat which also could dive and shoot small torpedos. I also created the motor/servo controller board btw!</li>
        <li>Used a high-voltage Geiger-M√ºller tube (LND 712) together with a radioactive alpha particle source (Americium-241 from an old smoke detector) as a random number generator.</li>
